JASON: Had to experiment with PuTTY because GitBASH for window does not support special characters. Downloaded PuTTY and learned how to SSH to the school server. Uploaded lanterna.jar and TerminalDemo.java to GitHub.
1/6/19
JASON: Tried to use atom on PuTTY. It did not work. Tried to find other text editors that might work with PuTTY. Really don't want to have to transfer files from school server to computer all the time.
1/7/19
JASON: Downloaded and experimented with FileZilla. Learned how to move files from bart.stuy.edu to PC. Took away some of the features in the provided TerminalDemo.java that won't be needed.
